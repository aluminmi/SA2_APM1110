## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ethereum}
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the CSV file with column specification
eth_data <- read_csv("C:/Users/Dindette/Downloads/ETH-USD.csv", col_types = cols())

# Calculate returns
eth_data <- eth_data %>%
  mutate(Return = (Close - lag(Close)) / lag(Close))

# Calculate data range and binwidth
data_range <- range(eth_data$Return, finite = TRUE)
if (length(data_range) != 2 || any(!is.finite(data_range))) {
  stop("Data range contains non-finite values.")
}
binwidth <- (data_range[2] - data_range[1]) / 250

# Plot histogram of returns with breaks set to 250
histogram <- ggplot(eth_data, aes(x = Return)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = binwidth, breaks = seq(data_range[1], data_range[2], by = binwidth), fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Ethereum Returns", x = "Percentage Change", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Perform Shapiro-Wilk normality test
shapiro_test_result <- shapiro.test(eth_data$Return)

# Print histogram plot and test result
print(histogram)
print(shapiro_test_result)

# While the W value is not far from 1, the p-value indicates that the data is unlikely to be normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. This is true as cryptocurrencies such as ethereum tend to be volatile and display occasional extreme fluctuations.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
